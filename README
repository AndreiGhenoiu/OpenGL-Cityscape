This program will generate a cityscape with several buildings and roads. Buildings have materials applied to them out 
of .jpeg files. There are also simple reflections, with the help of a few pools.
The project is done in Codeblocks.
Sorry for the misleading folder name for the project files (it started as a shadows and reflections practice for a final 
project for my Computer Graphics class and it went to a cityscape)
